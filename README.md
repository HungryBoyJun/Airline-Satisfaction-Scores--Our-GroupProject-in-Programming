# Airline-Satisfaction-Scores--Our-GroupProject-in-Programming
A group programming project demonstrating data analysis skills. We perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the "Airline Passenger Satisfaction" dataset sourced from Kaggle (teejmahal20). The code covers preprocessing, visualization, and insights derivation to understand which factors contribute most to passenger satisfaction.
